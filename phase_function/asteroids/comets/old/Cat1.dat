This is the first of 4 files for the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits 1996

File 2 contains orbits of single-apparition comets
     3 contains orbits of multiple-apparition comets
     4 contains the original, osculating and future 1/a values




In the basic files for the single-apparition and multiple-apparition comets
the columns give the following:

  1 to  15:  comet designation (in column 5, C indicates a long-period comet,
                P a short-period comet, D a short-period comet that has
                disappeared or is particularly uncertain)

 21 to  38:  perihelion time (generally TT since 1900, UT before 1900;
                in column 38, T denotes TT before 1900, U denotes UT after
                1900)
 
 40 to  47:  perihelion distance (AU)

 50 to  57:  eccentricity

 59 to  63:  revolution period (yr)

 66 to  73:  argument of perihelion (deg, J2000.0)

 76 to  83:  longitude of ascending node (deg, J2000.0)

 86 to  93:  inclination (deg, J2000.0)

 96 to 105:  epoch of osculation (almost invariably 0h UT or TT since
                1925, often 12h UT or TT before 1925)

107 to 112:  number of observations (in column 107, A = approximately, N =
                normal places; in column 112, * means nongravitational forces
                considered in solution)

114 to 136   span covered by observations

138          number of planets whose perturbations were considered

139          # denotes presumed principal component of split comet

143 to 170   comet name

171 to 182   orbit computer

183 to 186   year of publication of orbit


In the file for the original and future orbits the columns give the following:

  1 to  11   comet designation

 13 to  14   quality code (1A is best, 2B worst)

 18 to  22   perihelion distance (AU)

 25 to  29   inclination (deg, J2000.0)

             reciprocal of the semimajor axis (AU**-1)"

 32 to  40   "orginal" referred to barycenter of solar system

 43 to  51   osculating for the epoch (near perihelion), referred to the
                heliocenter

 54 to  62   "future" referred to barycenter of solar system
