The upper greyscale image shows the zodiacal light as observed by
the Clementine spacecraft while in orbit about the Moon in 1994.
The zodiacal light, which is the diffuse band of light seen
behind and beyond the lunar limb, is sunlight that is reflected by
the interplanetary dust that envelopes the solar system. The Sun is
just behind the lunar south pole, and Venus is the bright object
to the left. Ecliptic north and east are above and to the left
of the Sun in both images, which show logarithmic variations in
the brightness of the zodiacal light.

The 60x60 degree color mosaic shows a wide-angle view of the
dust that bathes the inner solar system. The datagap in the
center of this image indicates where the Moon blocked
out an otherwise blinding Sun, also shown to scale here as a
yellow dot. The faint linear features in this image are artifacts
in the data and are not real. These data were acquired over a
five--week interval, so several planets are visible at multiple
locations due to the spacecraft's as well as the planets' motions
about the Sun. From center-right to left these planets are are:
Mercury, Saturn, Mars, Mars, and Saturn.
