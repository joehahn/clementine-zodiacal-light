Hi Joe-

Not sure if Tim has responded to you (I haven't received a cc) --- I know h=
e was in a review panel this last week.
(Actually, I'm on a 1-day review panel myself in ~ a week, & have a lot of =
proposals to review beforehand, so I won't be able to make any headway on t=
his Note until mid-month)

To bring you up to date, I'm attaching the outline that he put together (wh=
ich I reformatted a bit) & added my comments/ suggestions - in blue.
Below is a copy of his response.  This is the present status of our dialogu=
e as far as I know. In a nutshell, what I will need to move ahead is to hav=
e the S/C observing parameters specified for our retrieval example(s), as c=
ommented below.

----------------------------------
Thanks for the feedback on the outline for the LHG Clementine GRL =85

Section 2

I assume the Clementine UV-VIS cam was not used due to concerns about point=
ing near the Sun =85?

Your suggested table might be quite long?  I think we should quote an estim=
ate of how many candidate images we anticipate are available =96 question f=
or Joe.  A table like this would certainly be good once we have analyzed so=
me images =85

I=92d like to see a figure of the viewing geometry, since it=92d help make =
the results more accessible =85.

Section 3

I just meant that Joe was trying to avoid including any LHG in his CZL mode=
l, but that some small amount might still have been included. On Monday, I =
mentioned that LHG =93contamination=94 might have been responsible for some=
 of the anomalous features in the Hahn et al. isophote figure (Fig. 12).  I=
 recall that Joe pointed out that this figure has a log scale such that the=
 anomalies are not as bad as they look. I guess the point is that the Hahn =
et al. CZL model is very good, but not perfect =85 I certainly did not want=
 to appear disparaging about the possibility of viewing LHG with the ST.

Section 4

I think the streamers are most likely crepuscular rays associated with surf=
ace topography, especially since they only appeared just before (~5 s) orbi=
tal sunrise. So I don=92t think we should try and model these here. I don=
=92t we need to make this more complicated at this stage =96 we have loads =
of new stuff as it is =85

The rest of your comments and changes looked good. I=92m sure we can trim t=
hings down once we start getting figures and text together.

Cheers, Tim

Hi Dave,

I'm away at a conference right now. But I will get back to you with a more =
thoughtful email when
I return home this weekend.

But I have not seen any outline of the Clementine LHG paper, so do send me =
a copy.

Also, has the fate of the LASER proposal been determined?

Cheers,
Joe

Subject: GRL paper - some ideas

Hi Joe-

We haven't had much dialogue since the LASER proposal - guess that
was in September.

I wonder if Tim sent you the outline of a short paper on the topic of
Clementine LHG observations.  (If you haven't received it, you should
get it soon).  My understanding is that we'll be putting this
together fairly quickly for submission to GRL -- probably within the
next couple of months.  It will include a fair amount of stuff from
the LASER proposal I believe.
I wanted to run some ideas by you & get your comments; I've chatted
with Tim a bit about most of the following ideas.

I'm thinking that this paper would include a 1D figure of LHG + CZL,
similar to that in the proposal, except that the simulations would
use the actual Clementine observing geometry, as listed in Hahn et
al., Table I.  It might also convey (additional traces) the relative
contribution of Na line emission, since that will need to be
separated from LHG.   We might also add a DN axis which shows the
actual ST response. It looks like that part shouldn't be a problem
since ST responsivity seems to be thoroughly addressed in the Hahn et
al. paper.

I would think that another important point to get across is that it's
feasible [let's hope] to retrieve coarse dust particle size &
altitude information from LHG present in the Clementine data - in the
presence of CZL. We would utilize 2D spatial information to the
greatest extent possible (since we don't have multi-spectral
information), and uncertainties would be driven by star tracker
sensitivity, dynamic range and absolute calibration.  I was thinking
of an additional figure something  contour plot(s) of CZL isophotes
-  lunar limb superimposed.  LHG would appear as perturbations on
those contours (details TBD - grin).

The coordinate system in my 2D LHG model (in it's present state) is
basically flexible.  It requires:
   1. spacecraft orbital altitude
   2. camera pixel scale
   3. selenographic central angle between spacecraft and terminator
   4. the pixel specifying the direction to sun center  (changing
this pixel just moves the map & limb positions around within the image fram=
e )

In order to superimpose CZL and keep track of the N-S and E-W
components, I'd also need to know the angle between my local x-axis
(this axis is tangent to the limb at the sunrise/set point) and
ecliptic N pole (or equator) at the time & location of observation(s).

So .. assuming that we want to use actual Clementine observing
circumstances (e.g., from your Table I), would it be a reasonable
request for you to back out

  - spacecraft altitude
  - central angle (#3 above) and
  - lunar horizon- ENP relative angle.

for one or more of the actual (Table I) observations?

Thanks !
(Any & all comments & suggestions would be appreciated)

- Dave
