Clementine Observations of the Zodiacal Light,
and the Dust Content of the Inner Solar System

Using the Moon to occult the Sun, the Clementine spacecraft used its navigation
cameras to map the zodiacal light, which is the sunlight that is reflected
by interplanetary dust. This surface brightness map is then used to infer the
spatial distribution of interplanetary dust over heliocentric distances from 10
solar radii out to the orbit of Venus. A simple model that attributes the zodiacal
light to three dust populations having distinct orbital distributions is then
applied to the observations. This model assumes that the interplanetary dust originates
from (i.) asteroids and Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) in low inclination orbits,
(ii.) Halley-type comets having intermediate inclinations, and (iii) high-inclination 
Oort Cloud comets. The best-fitting scenario indicates that asteroids + JFCs 
are the source of about half of the optical dust cross section seen in the ecliptic at
1 AU, but that at least 90% of the dust cross section enclosed by a 1-AU-radius sphere
is of cometary origin. When these results are then extrapolated out to the asteroid 
belt, I obtain an upper limit on the mass of light-reflecting asteroidal dust that
is equivalent to a 12-km asteroid. A similar extrapolation of the high-inclination dust
out to Oort Cloud distances also yields a mass equivalent to a 30-km comet,
although that mass is uncertain by orders of magnitude. Other findings will also be
reported, as well as a brief overview of the interplanetary dust field.
