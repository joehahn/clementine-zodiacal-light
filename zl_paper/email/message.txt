Dear Colleague,

Our paper entitled "Clementine Observations of the Zodiacal Light
and the Dust Content of the Inner Solar System", by J.M. Hahn,
H.A. Zook, B. Cooper, and B. Sunkara, has been accepted for
publication in Icarus. A preprint is available at the URL
www.lpi.usra.edu/science/hahn/public/other_files/clementine/clementine_v3.pdf 
and the abstract is given below. I hope you find it of interest.

Regards,

ABSTRACT

Using the Moon to occult the Sun, the Clementine spacecraft used
its navigation cameras to map the inner zodiacal light at optical
wavelengths over elongations of 3<epsilon<30 degrees from the Sun.
This surface brightness map is then used to infer the spatial
distribution of interplanetary dust over heliocentric distances of
about 10 solar radii to the orbit of Venus. The averaged ecliptic
surface brightness of the zodiacal light falls off as
Z~epsilon^{-2.45+-0.05} which suggests that the dust
cross-sectional density nominally falls off as r^{-1.45+-0.05}.
The interplanetary dust also has an albedo of a~0.1
that is uncertain by a factor of ~2. Asymmetries of ~10% are seen
in directions east-west and north-south of the Sun, and these
may be due the giant planets' secular gravitational perturbations.

We apply a simple model that attributes the zodiacal light as due 
to three dust populations having distinct inclination
distributions, namely, dust from asteroids and Jupiter-family
comets (JFCs) having characteristic inclinations of i~7 degrees,
dust from Halley-type comets having i~33 degrees, and an
isotropic cloud of dust from Oort Cloud comets. The best-fitting
scenario indicates that asteroids + JFCs are the source of about
45% of the optical dust cross-section seen in the ecliptic at
1 AU, but that at least 89% of the dust cross--section enclosed
by a 1 AU radius sphere is of a cometary origin. Each population's
radial density variations can also deviate somewhat from the
nominal r^{-1.45}. When these results are extrapolated out to the
asteroid belt, we find an upper limit on the mass of the
light-reflecting asteroidal dust that is equivalent to a 12 km
asteroid, and a similar extrapolation of the isotropic dust cloud
out to Oort Cloud distances yields a mass equivalent to a 30 km
comet, although the latter mass is uncertain by orders of
magnitude.
