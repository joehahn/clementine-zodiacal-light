Dear Phil,

I have uploaded the latest version of manuscript I08179 titled
"Clementine observations of the zodiacal light". You will
notice that all changes to the manuscript are cosmetic and
that the dispute with Bill Reach over my interpretation
of the Oort Cloud dust likely remains unresolved. Also,
my point-by-point response to his review only touches on the
handful of comments by Bill that resulted in actual revisions in
the manuscript. Bill's other comments are either inconsequential
or in error, and my failure to provide a more formal
response to those comments is just a sign of my fatigue.
I also apologize in advance for my brusque manner---ordinarily I
prefer a more delicate approach in such dealings, but
I also wish to put a quick end to a pointless debate.

Unless the current manuscript generates any substantive comments,
I shall consider this revision the final one. Please let me know
right away whether you wish to publish this paper in Icarus.

Regards,
Joe
